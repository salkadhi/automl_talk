# AutoML Talk

Data Science is one of the biggest growing fields in this decade. Tools and techniques developed by researchers and programmers are being used everywhere from academia to almost every industry. Due to the growing popularity of this field, the demand is outpacing the supply of experienced professional. Combined with the growing trend of automation, companies and open-source developers and created projects that effectively remove human input from parts building machine learning algorithms and delegated it to meta-algorithms. In this talk, I will summarize what I have learned about this nascent technology so far, and talk about the challenges faced when attempting to use it. For an example, I will make use of the open-source library auto-sklearn, because it is built on top of python's widely used sklearn machine learning library.
